I.e. that it was compiled and published automatically every time I made some changes to the source file.
Since 5 years ago, my CV is written using LaTeX, using (and modifying) the Awesome CV template. On top of that, I added a few things to make it bilingual, compiling either in Spanish or English, making the document available in multiple languages.</description></item></channel></rss>

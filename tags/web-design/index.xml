Yeah, I know, not the best thing for this purpose, but I started it a few years ago, when I was younger and carelessler&hellip;</p>
<p>A few days ago, I decided I wanted to refactor my website and create a whole new one, using a static site generator. Ended up deciding on Hugo, btw.</p>
<p>As the old one was a bit, well, clunky, I wanted the new one to be online ASAP as possible. But I needed a banner that said &ldquo;hey, I&rsquo;m still working on it, be careful&rdquo;. Well, I don&rsquo;t really needed it, but it&rsquo;s cool nevertheless.</p>
<p>My objective was to emulate a kind of &ldquo;caution&rdquo; tape, the yellow and black one that reminds you of roadworks. Making a stripes background wasn&rsquo;t difficult, thanks to tools like <a href="https://stripesgenerator.com/">stripesgenerator.com</a>, but the most important thing of all is adding a little tilt, simulating the falling tape.</p>
<p>This could be accomplished thanks to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function/rotate"><code>transform: rotate()</code></a> CSS property.</p>
<p>It ended up being something like this:</p>
<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-default-tab="css,result" data-slug-hash="bGvQdxo" data-user="daviddavo" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

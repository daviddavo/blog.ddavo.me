I know that Pocket is just a company and that they are just trying to provide value to its shareholders, but, come on, is that really a
PREMIUM feature? Are you really trying to charge me for a couple of extra bytes?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I decided to search for another read-it-later app, and I came across <a href="https://omnivore.app">Omnivore</a>. It is also
Open Source, which would let me self-host the application if I wanted to. I&rsquo;d be more than happy to pay a fair price for a
service I like, but in this case, it isn&rsquo;t necessary because it&rsquo;s completely free.</p>
<p>But first, I needed to migrate my data from Pocket to Omnivore. There is currently an open Issue in GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/omnivore-app/omnivore/issues/2050">#2050</a>) to provide an official Pocket integration, check in that thread if it has been already implemented before
continuing in this tutorial. In my case, after waiting a few weeks, I decided to get on my knees and implement it myself,
learning a bit of GraphQL on the way.</p>
<h1 id="exporting-your-data-from-pocket">Exporting your data from Pocket</h1>
<p>This was by far the easiest part, just visit <a href="https://getpocket.com/export">getpocket.com/export</a> and download the <code>ril_export.html</code> file.</p>
<h1 id="uploading-your-data-to-omnivore">Uploading your data to Omnivore</h1>
<p>I created a Jupyter Notebook to parse the <code>ril_export.html</code> file and make the proper GraphQL queries to Omnivore&rsquo;s API.
This notebook doesn&rsquo;t just create the article, it also archives it if it has been read in Pocket, and sets the upload date.</p>
<h2 id="getting-an-omnivore-api-key">Getting an Omnivore API key</h2>
<p>Because we are using a custom-made application, you will need a key to interact with Omnivore. You can find info on how
to create an Omnivore API key in the <a href="https://docs.omnivore.app/integrations/api.html#getting-an-api-token">official documentation</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/omnivore-web-create-api-token.png" type="" alt="Getting an omnivore API key"  /></p>
<h2 id="running-the-jupyter-notebook">Running the Jupyter Notebook</h2>
<p>I made a Jupyter Notebook using Beautiful Soup to process the <code>ril_export.html</code> file, and gql to run the GraphQL queries, as simple as it is. You can <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/daviddavo/pocket2omnivore/HEAD?labpath=pocket2omnivore.ipynb">run it online on Binder</a>.</p>
<p>It will ask you to upload the <code>ril_export.html</code> file. Remember to set up the global variables first! Especially the <code>OMNIVORE_API_KEY</code>.</p>
<p>After running, it will start uploading the URLs one by one. It will take a while. If you visit Omnivore, you&rsquo;ll see that some of these posts don&rsquo;t
have a title or a description. This is because it takes a while to crawl the website.</p>
<p>By the way, did you know that this page is intended to be fully compatible with Omnivore? Try adding some of my posts to your list!</p>

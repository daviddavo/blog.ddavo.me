The other day my supervisor gave me an interesting paper to read on data visualization: [Designing Alternative Representations of Confusion
Matrices to Support Non-Expert Public Understanding of
Algorithm Performance](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3415224) (full reference below, on _further reading_).

In case you don't know what a confusion matrix is, is a tool that we use in machine learning to visualize the performance of a classification algorithm.

This kind of algorithms have some data, that can be in some class or not, and try to predict whether new data is in that class or not. For example, let's say we have a model that classifies incoming mail as spam or not, we can use a confusion matrix to visualize how our original data is classified.

The confusion matrix is a contingency table of the training data with two dimensions: _actual_ and _predicted_, i.e.: a 2x2 table with every possibility of correct prediction, incorrect prediction, actually in that class, and actually not in that class.

To facilitate its visualization, this table is usually coloured as a _heatmap_, where every square has a colour representing the "strength" of the value.

{{< figure 
    src="heatmap.png" 
    alt="A sample confusion matrix with 47 true positives, 22 true negatives"
    caption="A sample confusion matrix with 47 True Positives and 22 True Negatives (69 correct predictions) and 9 incorrect predictions"
>}}

**Nevertheless, all of this can be difficult to understand at a glance for people who are not into Machine Learning**, and that's why Shen et. al explored those alternatives.

## Using bar charts

In the previously mentioned research paper, Hong et al. explore different representations of the same data and how they are understood by non-experts. From the results of their experiment, we can conclude that using a flow chart is the best way to make users who are not familiar with these plots understand them. Nevertheless, bar charts are better for _simulating_ in your head, i.e.: calculating where a certain case will fall in the classes.

Furthermore, bar charts are easier to code and take up less space, so we decided to use them for a technical audience who might not be familiar with confusion matrices but surely is familiar with bar charts.

{{< figure 
    src="bars.png" 
    alt="A sample confusion matrix with 47 true positives and 22 true falses"
    caption="The same data, but with another way of displaying it"
>}}

This figure highlights how there is a lot more spam than ham (non-spam).

Finally, without further ado, the Python code used to create this plot is:

```python
_palette = sns.colour_palette('Paired')

_total = _toplot['count'].sum()
_max = _toplot['count'].max()
_toplot['pct'] = _toplot['count'] / _total
print(_toplot)
print("Total:", _total, "max:", _max)

with sns.axes_style("white"):
    # Get the colour map
    # https://stackoverflow.com/a/38575399/4505998
    g = sns.catplot(
        data=_toplot.reset_index(), y='count', col='Predicted', row='Actual',
        kind='bar', height=2, margin_titles=True, palette=_palette,
    )

g.set(
    # Set the ylim to the 120% to leave some space for letters
    ylim=(0,_max*1.2),
    # Remove left ticks (redundant)
    yticks=[],
)

# Setting the titles
for ax,l in zip(g.axes[:,0],g.row_names):
    ax.set_ylabel(l)
g.set_titles(col_template="{col_name}", row_template="")

# Making it more beautiful
g.despine(left=True)

colours = [5, 4, 2, 3]
for i, ax in enumerate(g.axes.ravel()):
    # Setting the bar labels
    # Display the number and percentage of proposals in each class
    for c in ax.containers:
        labels = [f'{v.get_height():.0f} ({v.get_height()/_total*100:.1f}%)' for v in c]
        ax.bar_label(c, labels=labels)

        # Set the colour of each bar to a colourmap
        for b in c:
            # plt.setp(b, colour=_cmap(b.get_height() / _max))
            # plt.setp(b, colour=_cmap(b.get_height() / _total))
            plt.setp(b, colour=_palette[colours[i]])
            
plt.savefig("bars.png")
```
